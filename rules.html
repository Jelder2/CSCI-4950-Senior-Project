            <p>Overview: 
                Once the game begins, each participant will be given a target that they will have to “eliminate”. 
                To eliminate your target you must tag them and say, “I have the high ground”. 
                Once eliminated your target will give you a 4 digit pin that you will type in on the game tab to confirm the elimination and be assigned your next target. Beware that while you are hunting your target, you may actually be the prey since someone will be hunting you as well.
            </p>

                <li>To eliminate your target you must tag them and say “I have the high ground”</li>
                <li>If you are eliminated, you must give your code to your "killer". Failure to do this will result in a ban.</li>
                <li>Classes, Dorm rooms/apartments are safe areas. Do not approach your target.</li> 
                <li>Do not approach your target if they are in a safe area.</li>
                <li>Executive stalking is not allowed! If your target calls the cops thats your responsibility.</li>
                <li>USE COMMON SENSE - if you think you shouldn't be doing it, then don't do it.</li>
                <li>GMs are not responsible for what occurs between participants</li>
